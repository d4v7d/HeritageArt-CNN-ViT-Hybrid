# POC-5.9 SegFormer-B3 Configuration
# ViT Family - Pure transformer with hierarchical structure

# Inherit base config
_base_: "base_config.yaml"

# Model override - ViT encoder
model:
  architecture: "Unet"
  encoder_name: "tu-mit_b3"  # SegFormer Mix Transformer B3
  encoder_weights: "imagenet"
  in_channels: 3
  classes: 16
  activation: null
  
  # Architecture family metadata
  family: "vit"
  mechanism: "Efficient self-attention with overlapped patch merging"
  
# Data
data:
  image_size: 384  # Flexible resolution (no Swin window constraint)

# Training (same as base)
training:
  batch_size: 96
  epochs: 50

# Expected performance
# SegFormer designed for segmentation, should be best performer
# POC-5.9: 30.2 ± 0.9% mIoU (3-fold CV)
# This is the expected WINNER for RQ1 (ViT family)
