# POC-5.9 MaxViT-Tiny Configuration  
# Hybrid Family - Conv + Attention interleaving

# Inherit base config
_base_: "base_config.yaml"

# Model override - Hybrid encoder
model:
  architecture: "Unet"
  encoder_name: "tu-maxvit_tiny_tf_224"  # Can work at 384px despite name
  encoder_weights: "imagenet"
  in_channels: 3
  classes: 16
  activation: null
  
  # Architecture family metadata
  family: "hybrid"
  mechanism: "Multi-axis attention (block conv + grid attention)"
  
# Data
data:
  image_size: 384  # MaxViT supports flexible resolutions

# Training (same as base)
training:
  batch_size: 96
  epochs: 50

# Expected performance
# POC-5.5 (multi-head): 22.02% mIoU fine (best among 3 models)
# POC-5.9 (single-head, better loss, CV): 29.5 ± 1.0% mIoU
# Should be competitive with SegFormer, may be second best
